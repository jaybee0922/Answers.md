1.Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

Product Entity:

The "Product" entity represents individual items or goods that are available for sale or purchase.
It has several attributes, including:

*id: An identifier for each product (likely a unique numerical value).
*name: The name or title of the product etc.
*desc: A description of the product.
*SKU: Stock Keeping Unit, a unique code for inventory management.
*category_id: This attribute establishes a relationship with the "Product_Category" entity. It likely stores the ID of the associated *category.
*inventory_id: An identifier linking to the product’s inventory details.
*price: The price of the product.
\*Timestamps for creation, modification, and deletion.

Product_Category Entity:

The "Product_Category" entity represents different categories or types of products.
Its attributes include:

*id: A unique identifier for each category.
*name: The name of the category and etc.
*desc: A description of the category etc.
*Timestamps for creation, modification, and deletion.

Relationship:

2.How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

I. Foreign Key Constraint

\*Define a foreign key relationship between the "category_id" column in the "Product" table and the "id" column in the Product_Category table.

*This constraint ensures that every value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table corresponds to a valid category ID in the Product_Category table.
*If an attempt is made to insert or update a product with an invalid category ID, the database system will reject the operation.

II. Validation at the Application Level

*Implement validation logic in your application code.
*When adding or updating a product, verify that the specified category ID exists in the "Product_Category" table.
\*If not, raise an error or provide appropriate feedback to the user.

III. Default Category

*Assign a default category or other to products during creation if no specific category is provided.
*This ensures that all products have a valid category, even if the user doesn’t explicitly specify one.

IV. Data Integrity Checks

*Regularly perform data integrity checks to identify any inconsistencies.
*For example, run queries to find products with missing or invalid category IDs.
\*Correct any discrepancies found during these checks.
